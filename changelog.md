# 3.0.0

"Async Listen Rewrite"

Before this update the program handled having to keep track of multiple users with multiple processes. This turned out to be error prone and difficult to debug. The solution implemented in this update was rewriting the code to cycle between users listening to them asynchronously.

## Changes
- Async listening rewrite
- Started adding documentation to the repository.
