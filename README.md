# About

This is a script I wrote to track the amount of time I've listened to various artists, albums, and songs on Spotify. The time listened is stored in a json named "music-time.json" in miliseconds.

This program requires a config.ini file to specify the client id, secret, redirect uri, and scopes for the Spotify API.
